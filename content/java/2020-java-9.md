Java is a programming language and computing platform first released in 1995. Since then Java had gone through many changes and improvements until it reached its current version (version 13). Currently, Java is a fast, secure, and reliable programming language, used in data-centers, game consoles, cell phones to even scientific researched with supercomputers. **Java is literally everywhere!**

In this article, we will be looking at Java 9 release (2017) and the main new features and improvements since java 8 release (2014)**.** It won't include everything, but the ones which are more common or have more uses from my opinion.

# Modularity & Jigsaw

A major concern for software developers is designing big complex projects. When a project has tens of thousands of lines of code or even more, it becomes increasingly harder to have knowledge and understanding of code segments. To overcome the problem of repeating and mixing-up similar code in different stages of programming, modularity was designed and used. Modularity encourages the idea of separating code into distinct and independent segments that perform a specific functionality. These segments can be referenced from any part of the project. Similar segments and functions are grouped together and called modules.

Modules were introduced in java 9 for the first time. Prior to Java 9, classes resided in packages and classes within those packages were found by class loaders. Now, modules act in-between packages and class loaders. The resources and packages can be encapsulated from other modules in levels that were just not possible before. 

So now, it is impossible to use classes from other modules unless it was public class and explicitly exported from the module. For older projects, developers can use unnamed modules for backward compatibility. 

## Jigsaw project

[Project Jigsaw](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/) is the umbrella project for modularity in java. Using Jigsaw, we can create a modular based project and define relation between the modules, which will make the construction and maintaining of libraries easier. In addition, it will improve the applications performance and security.

The module system supports the top level construct, just like packages. Developers can declare dependencies between modules after creating the modules, the definition will be added to the module's info file (module-info.java).

A general Jigsaw project's structure of the modules looks like:

```
src
|----com.test.greetings
|    |----module-info.java
|    |----com
|         |----greetings
|              |----GreetingsWorld.java
|----com.test.hello
     |----module-info.java
     |----com
          |----hello
               |----HelloWorldImpl.java
               |----HelloWorldInterface.java
```

## Module usage and Terminologies

With the introduction of modularity, new terminologies were added as well.

* **module**: the module definition file starts with this keyword followed by its name and definition.

```java
module com.greetings{
}
```

* **requires**: used to indicate the modules it depends on; a module name has to be specified after this keyword.

  ```
  module com.greetings{
    requires com.hello;
  }
  ```
* **requires static*:*** used when the dependency is option, it will make the dependency compile-time-only dependency.

```
module com.greetings{
  requires static com.hello;
}
```

* **requires transitive[](https://www.baeldung.com/java-9-modularity#3-requires-transitive):** any module depends on the module defining requires transitive <modulename> gets an implicit dependence on the <modulename>.

  ```
  module com.greetings{
    requires transitive com.hello;
  }
  ```
* **exports**: is used to indicate the packages within the module available publicly, a package name has to be specified after this keyword.

  ```
  module com.hello {
      exports com.hello;
  }
  ```
* **exports ... to:** it is used to restrict the exported packages from the modules to specific modules.



  ```
  module com.hello {
      exports com.hello to com.greetings;
  }
  ```
* **open**: is used to indicate the packages that are accessible only at runtime and also available for introspection via Reflection APIs.

  ```
  open module com.hello {
  }
  ```
* **opens:** is used when not the entire model needed to be accessible but a specific packages. 

  ```
  module com.hello {
      opens com.hello;
  }
  ```
* **opens...to:** similar to "**opens**", but only specific packages can access it.



  ```
  module com.hello {
      opens com.hello to com.greetings;
  }
  ```
* **uses**: is used to indicate the service interface or abstract class that this module is using.

  ```
  module com.greetings {
      uses com.hello.HelloWorldInterface;
  }
  ```
* **provides â€¦ with**: it is used to indicate that it provides implementations, identified after the with keyword, for the service interface identified after the provides keyword

```
module com.hello {
    provides com.hello.HelloWorldInterface with com.hello.HelloWorldImpl;
}
```

Java 9 has huge changes, many of which were used in other programming languages such as Python and Scala. I didn't cover everything as there are more exciting features and tools not mentioned here, I would recommend checking the documentation, it has a great **"what's new"** session.
